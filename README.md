# Turnip Price Database in *Animal Crossing New Horizons*

Simple C++ program I wrote to keep track of Animal Crossing turnip prices. Stores that data in a SQLite database.

This does require that sqlite3 be installed, which you can do with:

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
`sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev`
